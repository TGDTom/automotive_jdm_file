# About this file

Hi there,
I have this .jdm file, which is an update file for a digital automotive gauge cluster. I'm looking to modify it to use my own and custom assets/skins/values in the digital car cluster. This file specifically adds a 'sportive skin' to the cluster. I've done research for a few days, but cannot find the software/IDE to open it.


## Some tips
- There's a big chance that the .jdm extension isn't the original file type. However, putting the file in a HEX editor doesn't seem to reveal the original extension type;
- I think the software used to compile/create this file includes some type of visual GUI editor, along with a code editor;
- It could be that this file is in proprietary format, not sure about that though;
- Possible coding languages used are C, C++, C#, Python, as seen in this screenshot from their development video:

- Unfortunately, no other hints could be found in this video.

## The reward

The person that can provide me with the following information, will receive $100.00 through Bountysource:

- The software that can be used to open the file and edit the source code of it, as well as it's GUI, that's it! It does have to work and I need to be able to re-compile the edited file again in the .JDM filetype.

## Permissions

You can do whatever you want with the file! Please let me know if you need any more specific info that I might know.
